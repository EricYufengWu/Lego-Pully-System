This is a customizable, interactive pulley system that can be used in various classroom settings to help students learn basic physics concepts. The entire set up can be created using parts from a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit, some strings and any kinds of weight. Alternatively, as provided by this document, using 3D-printed parts can further enhance the performance of the pulley system.
